# hacker-news

This basic hacker news clone [(based off of this site)](https://news.ycombinator.com/) was an introductory project to learn the fundamentals of ruby on rails. The site is fully functional and incorporates many important aspects of backend web design including:

* Users can create accounts/log in
* Posts are displayed on homepage sorted by newest or by highest scoring
* Polymorphic nested comment system
* Polymorphic voting system
* User karma

The project tests with RSpec using shoulda-matchers and Capybara. It is currently deployed on heroku at [this url](https://dry-stream-66715.herokuapp.com/).
